To assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. Know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organization’s IT system, thus circumventing most of perimeter controls in place. Your answer should be provided in the form of a draft email/memo explaining your findings and conclusions of controls currently used by an organization to prevent successful cracking of passwords and potential uplifts that you would propose to existing controls with justifications.  As your task, You must determine the following:  What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords? What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords? What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again? What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)? What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder?
